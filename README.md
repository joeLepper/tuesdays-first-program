# Hello, World!
## A record of a six-year-old playing with code


Tuesday is learning how to write code. This is where we are keeping track of her iterations. Every time we complete a working version of the program we will cut a commit and make a note of how the program was changed.

### How this works

This README is written (for now) by her dad. Everything in the program is typed by Tueser (except for comments, which I am sometimes adding for posterity and sometimes because we use them during instruction.

0.0.1
----

We made a function! It accepts a string and says hello!

0.0.2
----

We used our makeNamer function to say hello to the whole family!

0.0.3
----

That escalated quickly. As soon as we got finished with a loop Tues wanted to make it repeat over and over again AND for there to be a delay between each time it said hello. Welcome to asynchrnous programming, love.
