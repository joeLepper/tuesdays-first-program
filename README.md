# Hello, World!
## A record of a six-year-old playing with code


Tuesday is learning how to write code. This is where we are keeping track of her iterations. Every time we complete a working version of the program we will cut a commit and make a note of how the program was changed. This README is written (for now) by her dad. Everything in the program is typed by Tueser.

0.0.1

We made a function! It accepts a string and says hello!
